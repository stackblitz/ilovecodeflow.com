## What is Codeflow?

Codeflow is a one-click integration with GitHub for seamless coding workflows.

StackBlitz now helps you switch contexts seamlessly:

- [**Codeflow IDE**](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/working-in-codeflow-ide) is a fully fledged desktop-grade dev environment capable of running your whole workflow - from production-level dev work to reviewing pull requests.
- [**Web Publisher**](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/content-updates-with-web-publisher) is a publishing tool that makes editing docs or blogs pleasant thanks to a realtime preview of the changes.
- [**pr.new**](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/using-pr-new) is a short URL that can be used on any repository to explore code, a branch or an issue, to review a PR, or even to edit a file, all in a live environment with a realtime preview.
- [**CodeflowApp**](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/integrating-codeflowapp-bot) is a friendly bot, which provides a one-click link that spins up the whole environment for pull requests and issues. No more context-switching or branch-checkouts, just a new browser tab with a full IDE and a dev server running.
